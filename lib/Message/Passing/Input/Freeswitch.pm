=head1 NAME

Message::Passing::Input::Freeswitch - input messages from Freeswitch.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    message-pass --input Freeswitch --input_options \
        '{"hostname":"127.0.0.1","secret":"s3kriTk3y"}' \
        --output STDOUT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Produces a message stream from a L<Freeswitch|http://www.freeswitch.org/>
instance.

Uses the Freeswitch L<|Event Socket Library|http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Event_Socket_Library>
to connect to a local or remote Freeswitch instance and stream event messages.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 hostname

The Freeswitch host to connect to.

=head2 secret

The secret configured in Freeswitch for connecting to the event listener socket.

=head2 connection_retry_timeout

The number of seconds to wait after a disconnect before reconnecting. Default 3.

=head2 port

The port that Freeswitch's ESL socket is listening on. Defaults to 8021.

=head2 events

An arrayref of types of events to listen for. These types are documented
L<on the Freeswitch wiki|http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Event_List>.

By default, the special type, C<all> is used - which means all event types
are subscribed to.
